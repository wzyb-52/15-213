# README

This is a repository that documents all my efforts to finish the labs of CSAPP.

## Lab1 Data

`isTmax(x)`, `conditional`, `isLessOrEqual`, and `howManyBits` puzzles are a little tricky. See the comments which explain the ideas of solution in detail.

## Lab2 Bomb

`psol.txt` is the answer sheet. Phase3 is similar to `switch` branches and has several solutions. Phase5 also has multiple answers(tip: **reminders** are *9, f e, 5, 6, 7*). Phase6 is a little complex(tip: *decrement order of an array*).
